"""Given an integer array Arr of size N the task is to find the count of elements whose value is greater than all of its prior elements.

Note : 1st element of the array should be considered in the count of the result.

For example,

Arr[]={7,4,8,2,9}

As 7 is the first element, it will consider in the result.

8 and 9 are also the elements that are greater than all of its previous elements.

Since total of  3 elements is present in the array that meets the condition.

Hence the output = 3. """
